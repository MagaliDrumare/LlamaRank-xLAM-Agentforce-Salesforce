### Salesforce LlamaRank - 26 August 2024
As part of our commitment to innovation in enterprise RAG and trusted AI, we're excited to release SFR LlamaRank, a state-of-the-art reranker from Salesforce AI Research. LlamaRank is a language model specialized for document relevancy ranking. LlamaRank achieves performance at least comparable to leading APIs across general document ranking while demonstrating a marked improvement in code search. LlamaRankâ€™s performance was largely due to multiple rounds of iterative on-policy feedback provided by the Salesforce RLHF data annotation team.
