# Salesforce Generative AI

# Einstein Copilot 
Einstein Copilot is a conversational AI assistant that processes natural language commands and generates responses based on your business data.
Businesses can adapt Einstein Copilot by using custom data fields in Salesforce, allowing the AI to provide responses tailored to unique business information.
Existing Salesforce workflows, such as Flows and Apex classes, can be integrated with Einstein Copilot by adding them as custom actions with descriptive metadata.
Prompts can be customized with business-specific data and context, enabling the AI to generate more meaningful and relevant responses.
The three key ways to adapt the AI are: using custom Salesforce data, incorporating existing workflows, and creating tailored prompts for more precise AI responses.

### Salesforce LlamaRank - 26 August 2024
As part of our commitment to innovation in enterprise RAG and trusted AI, we're excited to release SFR LlamaRank, a state-of-the-art reranker from Salesforce AI Research. LlamaRank is a language model specialized for document relevancy ranking. LlamaRank achieves performance at least comparable to leading APIs across general document ranking while demonstrating a marked improvement in code search. LlamaRank’s performance was largely due to multiple rounds of iterative on-policy feedback provided by the Salesforce RLHF data annotation team.
